Loom 
===============
<img src="" align="right" margin="10px" padding="10px"> 

Loom is a code playground that lets multiple users work on the same file in real time. 
It's intended as a new way to collaborate and teach. Essentially it's an experiment that 
attempts to be a hybrid of Google Docs and Codepen (or jsfiddle, jsbin, etc...)

Loom accomplishes this task using node and websocks with some angular sprinkled in here and there.

Front-end: 
- Angular
- Bootstrap
- Jade

Back-end: 
- Node + Express
- mongoDB + Mongoose

Notable libraries and modules: 
- Ace 9 
- Passport
- socket.io 

I chose the MEAN stack because node and websockets play well together. They're also extremely fast
which is critical in an application that has real-time elements.
